An ant algorithm implemeted for solving the delivery problem. The algorithm receives a file with the locations of where to arrive, and solves this problem by showing the solution in the form of a diagram. The goal is to travel as short a distance as possible, using as few cars as possible. A new car is added when the previous cars have no places left for them to visit. Additional constraints:
1. Each point has its own hour window in which it can receive a car, as well as its own unloading time
2. a car is limited by its load capacity

Examples of the best solutions:
![C201 Population 60](https://github.com/PavelRadkevich/Logistic-problem/blob/master/wykresy/Population60/C201.png)
The distance in this case is 595.63, which is only 6.53 more than the best known for us result
![C101 Population 60](https://github.com/PavelRadkevich/Logistic-problem/blob/master/wykresy/Random5/C101.png)
Analogic situation, distance in this case is 842.52, which is only 15.21 more than the best known for us result
